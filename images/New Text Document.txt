A computer science graduate student who is incredibly obsessed on UX and UI design. 
Extremely curious about coming up with digital merchandise applying UX and UI principles and
methodologies.Actively seeking new Opportunities for UX & UI design roles.My interests
 range from Graphic Design to UI. I am also interested in UX, web design, and Mobile design. 
I love helping brands, companies and organisations connect with their audience through good design.
 Good design is good business and I find that there is nothing more fulfilling than seeing a company grow through the power of design. 
In a minimalistic and customer oriented way I solve design problems on the daily for companies across the globe.
